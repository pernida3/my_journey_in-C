# My Journey in C 

Welcome to my personal archive of C programs — a collection of all the small projects, demos, and experiments I’ve written while learning C, especially through the CS50 course.It includes a wide range of beginner programs written during my exploration of topics like:

- Loops and conditionals
- Functions and parameters
- Arrays and strings
- ASCII manipulation
- Algorithms (Greedy, Luhn, etc.)
- Command-line arguments
- Manual implementations of C standard library functions

This repository reflects my growth as a programmer, from foundational logic and loops to memory and algorithmic thinking. 


## Folder Structure

- `final_version/` - Clean, well-commented, working versions of the programs
- `rough_and_concepts/` - Early drafts, experimental versions, and concept demos



## About the CS50 Library

Some of these programs use the [CS50 Library](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/), specifically `#include <cs50.h>`, which provides functions like `get_int()`, `get_string()`, etc.

⚠️ **Note**: These will only compile if you have the CS50 Library installed. If you're compiling outside of a CS50 environment, you'll either need to:
- Install the CS50 library on your system
- Or replace CS50 functions with standard C alternatives (`scanf`, etc.)

## Why This Repo?

This archive is part of my effort to build a solid foundation in low-level programming before advancing to higher-level concepts. It also serves as a personal record of progress and persistence.
